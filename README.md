# Installations for mac ###

This is a list of commands for installing everything you might need for the Ironhack data analytics bootcamp. 

- First, make sure you change your **github** username and email

- Second, change the **MySQL** password at the end of the file

- Third, add any other **GUI** you need with: 
```bash
brew install --cask notion
```

Now, run the bash script. You will probably need to grant permissions.
